B. National and Oregon CHILD COUNTS

NOTE TO SELF: ADD THE CENSUS NUMBER FOR FINAL PROJECT! BIND_ROWS!! WEEK 2? 3? Labs.

B-1. Load data

```{r B-1 load data}
#|label: load-OSEP-CHILDCOUNT-1920-data
# Imported excel file with multiple pages but specified only the second sheet. Yay 

childcount1920 <- read_excel("/Users/hata/Desktop/EDLD652_Diss/Data/1920-cchildcountandsettings-11.xlsx", sheet = 2)
```

```{r B-1 load clean names}
#|label: load-OSEP-CHILDCOUNT-1920-clean_names()
# I cleaned names, then decided against clean_names as it messed up the column names, but it might be necessary as the file is not rendering 
childcount1920 <- clean_names(childcount1920)
```

```{r B-1 label}
#|label: load-OSEP-CHILDCOUNT-1920-filter_US_OR

childcount1920USOR <- childcount1920 %>% 
  filter(state %in% c("US and Outlying Areas", "Oregon"))
```

where did the data go wrong? Did i combine it in below? But i think I just chose and selected the one i don't need? The one below is still correct. Where is the error?

```{r B-1 delete "total 100% column"}

childcount1920USOR <- childcount1920 %>%
  filter(state %in% c("US and Outlying Areas", "Oregon")) %>%
  select(- "race_ethnicity_total3_percent")

C. National and Oregon EXIT data by RACE

```{r C-1 load OSEP data}
#|label: load-OSEP-EXIT-data
# importing the data and cleaning it up: 
# This is the year 2013-2022. 
# 1. REMOVED DECEASED and NOT IN USE IN OREGON CATEGORY
# 2. CREATED THE complete_or_not_eligible combining three categories 

byrace <- import(here("Data", "race v.2.xlsx")) %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  select(-7, -12) %>% 
  mutate(complete_or_not_eligible = complete_prior_to_reaching_max_age_for_part_c + not_eligible_for_part_b_exit_with_no_referrals + not_eligible_for_part_b_exit_with_referrals_to_other_programs)
```

I FIXED THE MISSING COLUMN by adding back part_b_eligibility_not_determined. I think this is what I can use for CHI-SQUARE WITH RESIDUALS?

```{r C-1 load OSEP data label: aggregated-by-race}

agg_by_race_and_state <- byrace %>% 
  group_by(race, area) %>% 
  summarize(exit_total = sum(exiting_total2), 
            withdrawal_by_parent = sum(withdrawal_by_parent),
            attempts_to_contact_unsuccessful = sum(attempts_to_contact_unsuccessful),
            moved_out_of_state = sum(moved_out_of_state),
            part_b_eligible_exiting_part_c = sum(part_b_eligible_exiting_part_c),
            complete_or_not_eligible = sum(complete_or_not_eligible), 
            part_b_eligibility_not_determined = sum(part_b_eligibility_not_determined))
```

I should be able to export df to excel this way but haven't tried it yet.

```{r C-1 try to export OSEP data as Excel}
# library(writexl)
# df <- tibble::tibble(A = 1:5, B = 6:10, C = 11:15)  # Example tibble
# write_xlsx(df, "my_data.xlsx")  # Saves to an Excel file 
```

agg_by_race_and_state

```{r C-1 OSEP data agg_by_race}
# aggregated by race for OR
race_oregon <- agg_by_race_and_state %>%
  filter(area == "Oregon")
```

```{r C-1 OSEP data aggregated by race for US}
race_us <- agg_by_race_and_state %>% 
  filter(area == "US and Outlying Areas") 
```

```{r C-1 OSEP data race_by_us}
race_us <- race_us %>% 
  select(-area)
```

```{r C-1 OSEP data renaming category names to full names for race_us}

    "HI" = "Hispanic/Latino",
    "WH" = "White",
    "MU" = "Two or More Races",
    "PI" = "Pacific Islander"
  ))

```

```{r C-1 Made it LONGER}
us_data_long <- race_us %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = 3:7, 
    values_to = "values",
    names_to = "names"
  ) %>% 
  group_by(race) %>% 
  mutate(percentage = round(values/exit_total, digits = 4))
```

```{r C-1 OSEP made it WIDER}
us_data_wide <- us_data_long %>% 
  select(-c(exit_total,values)) %>% 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = names,
    values_from = percentage
  ) 
```

OH NO where did Part B eligibility not determined go?!?!?

```{r C-1 OSEP Changing category names in us_data_wide to clearner names}
us_data_wide <- us_data_wide %>% 
  rename(
    "Withdrawal by Parents" = withdrawal_by_parent,

I'm trying out to see if I can do the chi-square with residuals (per <https://chatgpt.com/share/67a1833d-9fc4-8012-8193-b6fc358a9687>)

Chi-square with Residuals 1:

```{r}
race_matrix <- as.matrix(race_us[ , -1])
race_matrix <- apply(race_matrix, 2, as.numeric)
```

R doesn't like spaces or dashes / - that's why we did clean names, it could work but it can be tricky later

```{r}
rownames(race_matrix) <- c("Alaska Native/American Indian", "Asian", "Black/African American", "Hispanic/Latino", "More than Two Races", "Pacific Islander", "White")
```

Chi-square with Residuals 2:

```{r}
chi_result <- chisq.test(race_matrix)
print(chi_result)
```

Chi-square with Residuals 3:

Cameron: Residuals are what we are measuring anyway. If nothing was happening, what would be the expected values in the cells in the matrix (so the residuals = differences between expected and what we see) so it's a raw differences

```{r}
print(chi_result$stdres)
# Residual > +2 â†’ Observed count is higher than expected.
# Residual < -2 â†’ Observed count is lower than expected.
```

Chi-square with Residuals 4:

```{r}
residuals_df <- as.data.frame(as.table(chi_result$stdres))
```

Cameron: How can I reverse the order of Y axis (and I should delete the exit total row too)

Chi-square with Residuals: Viz 1 (HEATMAP)

```{r}
# this is race on X (columns )
ggplot(residuals_df, aes(Var1, Var2, fill = Freq)) +
  geom_tile() +
  scale_fill_gradient2(low = "blue", mid = "white", high = "red") +
  labs(title = "Chi-Square Standardized Residuals",
       x = "Exit Reason", y = "Race") +
  theme_minimal() 
```

Chi-square with Residuals: Viz 2 (CORRPLOT: https://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/chi-square-test-of-independence-in-r#google_vignette)

```{r}
colnames(race_matrix)
```

```{r}
#drop total column from race_matrix. I learned that I CANNOT USE SELECT() ON MATRIX FILES SO I CONVERTED IT BACK TO DF THEN BACK TO MATRIX AGAIN 
race_matrix <- as.data.frame(race_matrix)
race_matrix <- race_matrix %>% 
  select(-exit_total)

race_matrix <- as.matrix(race_matrix)
```
